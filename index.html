			<h2>PR Professional and Digital Storyteller</h2>
			<p>I am lucky enough to be navigating the rough road of post grad life in our nation’s capital, which in case you were unaware, is pretty awesome. There are tons of young people, tons of opportunities, and even some great opportunities to meet those other youngin’s running around DC. What could be so bad about happy hour hopping? I am of the opinion that there are still plenty of challenges to overcome, but I think I might just be figuring it out a bit better these days.</p>

<p>I wanted a place to document those challenges, their solutions, and to start conversations on the issues that I find important for those who may also be struggling/interested in the same way. I also am one to find adventures that pop up regularly, and blogs are great for documenting that too. My motto is work hard, play harder, and it’s all fair game.</p>
